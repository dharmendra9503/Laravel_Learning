# Laravel Overview

#### Laravel is a PHP framework used for building web applications. It is designed to make the development process easier and more enjoyable by providing a clean and elegant syntax. Laravel follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern, which helps in separating the logic of an application into three interconnected components.


## Key Features of Laravel

#### **Eloquent ORM**: A powerful Active Record implementation for working with your database.
#### **Routing**: A simple and expressive way to define routes for your application.
#### **Blade Templating Engine**: A lightweight yet powerful templating engine for creating dynamic views.
#### **Authentication**: Built-in features for handling user authentication and authorization.
#### **Artisan Console**: A command-line tool for automating repetitive tasks.
#### **Middleware**: A mechanism for filtering HTTP requests entering your application.

## Laravel Directory Structure

<pre>When you create a new Laravel project, it comes with a predefined directory structure. </br>Here’s an overview of the main files and folders:

<b>app/ :</b> Contains the core code of your application, including models, controllers, and middleware.

<b>bootstrap/ :</b> Contains the app.php file which bootstraps the framework.

<b>config/ :</b> Contains all of your application’s configuration files.

<b>database/ :</b> Contains your database migrations, seeders, and factories.

<b>public/ :</b> The public directory contains the index.php file, which is the entry point for all requests entering your application.

<b>resources/ :</b> Contains your views (Blade templates), raw assets (SASS, JavaScript, etc.), and language files.

<b>routes/ :</b> Contains all of your route definitions. By default, there are web.php and api.php files.

<b>storage/ :</b> Contains compiled Blade templates, file-based sessions, file caches, and other files generated by the framework.

<b>tests/ :</b> Contains your automated tests.

<b>vendor/ :</b> Contains your Composer dependencies.
</pre>


</br>

## Blade Templating Engine
#### Blade is the simple yet powerful templating engine provided with Laravel. All Blade templates should use the .blade.php file extension and are typically stored in the resources/views directory.

<pre>
<b>Blade provides a variety of directives for common tasks:</b>

@if: Conditional statements.

@foreach: Looping through data.

@include: Including other Blade templates.

@extends and @section: Template inheritance.

{{ $slot }}: Echoing variable 
</pre>

# Laravel Migration Guide

This guide provides instructions on how to create and run migration files using Laravel's Artisan command-line tool.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- PHP
- Composer
- Laravel

## Artisan Commands Overview

To view all Artisan commands related to Laravel, use the following command in your terminal:

```
php artisan list
```

### Creating a Migration File

To create a new migration file, use the make:migration Artisan command. This command will generate a new migration file in the database/migrations directory.

```
php artisan make:migration <migration_file_name>
```

<div style="background-color: white; color: black; padding: 10px; border-left: 6px solid #ccc; transition: all 0.3s ease;">
<strong>Note:</strong> Path to see the created file: /project_path/database/migrations
</div>

### Running Migrations
After creating the migration file, you can run the migration to update your database schema. Use the migrate Artisan command to apply all pending migrations.

```
php artisan migrate
```

### Additional Information
If you need to roll back the last migration operation, you can use the following command:

```
php artisan migrate:rollback
```
To refresh the entire database and run all migrations from scratch, use:

```
php artisan migrate:refresh
```

For more advanced migration options, refer to the [Laravel Migration Documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/migrations).

# Eloquent

Eloquent is Laravel's built-in Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) that provides an expressive and easy-to-use syntax for interacting with your database. It simplifies database operations by allowing you to work with your database using models rather than writing raw SQL queries.

### Models:

Models in Eloquent represent tables in your database. Each model corresponds to a table and interacts with it. 

For example, if you have a users table, you would create a User model to interact with this table.
```
php artisan make:model User
```
<pre><strong style="color: orange">NOTE:</strong> This command generates a User model in the <strong>app/Models</strong> directory. </pre>

### Retrieving Data:

Eloquent provides several methods to retrieve data from your database. The most common ones include `all()`, `find()`, `where()`, and `get()`.

```php
// Retrieve all users
$users = User::all();

// Retrieve a user by primary key
$user = User::find(1);

// Retrieve users with a specific condition
$activeUsers = User::where('active', 1)->get();
```

### Inserting Data:

You can insert data into your database using Eloquent's `save()` method or the `create()` method.

```php
// Using save() method
$user = new User;
$user->name = 'John Doe';
$user->email = 'johndoe@example.com';
$user->save();

// Using create() method
User::create([
    'name' => 'Jane Doe',
    'email' => 'janedoe@example.com',
]);
```

<pre><strong style="color: orange">NOTE:</strong> To use the create() method, make sure the fields are listed in the $fillable property of the model to allow mass assignment.
<code>
class User extends Model
{
    protected $fillable = ['name', 'email'];
}
</code>
</pre>

### Updating Data:

Updating data is as simple as retrieving the model, modifying the attributes, and then saving it.

```php
// Updating a user
$user = User::find(1);
$user->email = 'newemail@example.com';
$user->save();

// Using update() method
User::where('id', 1)->update(['email' => 'newemail@example.com']);
```
### Deleting Data:

Eloquent allows you to delete records using the `delete()` method. You can either delete a specific record or multiple records based on a condition.

```php
// Deleting a single user
$user = User::find(1);
$user->delete();

// Deleting multiple users
User::where('active', 0)->delete();
```

### For more detailed information about Eloquent, refer to the official [Laravel Eloquent documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/eloquent)

# Model Factories

Model Factories allow us to create models with fake data, making it easier to test and seed your database. Laravel provides a fluent API for defining factories and comes with built-in support for Faker, a library for generating fake data.

## Creating a model factory

To create a new factory in Laravel, you can use the make:factory Artisan command:

```bash
# This is the most common command, where you specify the factory name and associate it with a model.
php artisan make:factory UserFactory --model=User

# Creating a Factory Without a Model
php artisan make:factory UserFactory

# Creating model with factory
php artisan make:model User -f

# If you want to overwrite an existing factory class, you can use the --force option:
php artisan make:factory UserFactory --model=User --force
```
