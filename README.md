# Laravel Overview

#### Laravel is a PHP framework used for building web applications. It is designed to make the development process easier and more enjoyable by providing a clean and elegant syntax. Laravel follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern, which helps in separating the logic of an application into three interconnected components.


## Key Features of Laravel

#### **Eloquent ORM**: A powerful Active Record implementation for working with your database.
#### **Routing**: A simple and expressive way to define routes for your application.
#### **Blade Templating Engine**: A lightweight yet powerful templating engine for creating dynamic views.
#### **Authentication**: Built-in features for handling user authentication and authorization.
#### **Artisan Console**: A command-line tool for automating repetitive tasks.
#### **Middleware**: A mechanism for filtering HTTP requests entering your application.

## Laravel Directory Structure

<pre>When you create a new Laravel project, it comes with a predefined directory structure. </br>Here’s an overview of the main files and folders:

<b>app/ :</b> Contains the core code of your application, including models, controllers, and middleware.

<b>bootstrap/ :</b> Contains the app.php file which bootstraps the framework.

<b>config/ :</b> Contains all of your application’s configuration files.

<b>database/ :</b> Contains your database migrations, seeders, and factories.

<b>public/ :</b> The public directory contains the index.php file, which is the entry point for all requests entering your application.

<b>resources/ :</b> Contains your views (Blade templates), raw assets (SASS, JavaScript, etc.), and language files.

<b>routes/ :</b> Contains all of your route definitions. By default, there are web.php and api.php files.

<b>storage/ :</b> Contains compiled Blade templates, file-based sessions, file caches, and other files generated by the framework.

## Blade Templating Engine

<b>Blade provides a variety of directives for common tasks:</b>

@if: Conditional statements.

@foreach: Looping through data.

@include: Including other Blade templates.
